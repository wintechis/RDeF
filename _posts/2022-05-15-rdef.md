## Abstract
Traditional database courses mainly focus on managing relational databases, but understanding NoSQL databases is becoming more relevant to computer science students. This also applies to Linked Data with the standards RDF and SPARQL where training material is scarce. Scarcity can be countered by involving students in the creation process. This paper introduces RDeF --- an open-source prosumer framework where students can consume and produce interactive stories to train their RDF and SPARQL skills. Stories are composed of scenes that are created with RDF triples from templates. Within stories, players must identify hidden RDF triples to build the knowledge base and query it by executing SPARQL requests to answer questions.
